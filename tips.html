				<h2>Tips</h2>
				<p> There are many tricks in Guild Wars 2 that are not obvious, not documented properly and can take a
				long time to figure out. This is an attempt to collect as many as possible and order them. For this
				reason we have two attributes for each tip: usefulness and importance. Both scale from 5 (very
				useful/important) to 1 (not much useful/important).
				</p>

				<p><i>Usefulness</i> is a selfish measure and shows you how much useful this tip is to you.</p>

				<p><i>Importance</i> on the other hand is a measure of how much other players rely on you to know this.</p>

				<p>It is very possible that we have forgotten a trick or maybe don't even know them. There may also be
				mistakes or outdated information. Any contributions are welcome, feel free to <a
				href="https://github.com/gw2scratch/tips/issues">create an issue</a> or even <a

				<h3>Beginner Tips</h3>
				<scr-tip usefulness="5" importance="5">
					<tip-title>Defiance bars</tip-title>
					<tip-desc>
						<p>
						Defiance bars, also known as breakbars are most commonly found on champions and legendary
						enemies. Appearing as a second bar under the enemies healthbar, it is damaged by using crowd
						control effects (often abbreviated as <em>CC</em>). As it would make no sense to allow a boss to
						be permanently stunned or blinded, this bar is the equivalent of a healthbar for crowd control
						skills.
						</p>

						<figure>
							<img src="images/breakbar_teal.jpg" alt="Damageable defiance bar" />
							<figcaption>A damageable defiance bar</figcaption>
						</figure>

						<p>
						When the bar is teal, using crowd control skills damages the bar. Depleting it – <em>breaking the
							enemy</em> – will stun the enemy temporarily and usually apply a buff that increases
						incoming damage to the enemy. The bar may be slowly regenerating while it is teal.
						</p>

						<figure>
							<img src="images/breakbar_teal_damaged.jpg" alt="Damaged defiance bar" />
							<figcaption>A defiance bar after the enemy was hit by a crowd control skill</figcaption>
						</figure>

						<p>
						When the bar is orange and filling up, it is recharging. The enemy is still immune and using
						crowd control skills now will be a waste as they are ignored. Once it fills up, the bar will
						become teal again and you can break the enemy again.
						</p>

						<figure>
							<img src="images/breakbar_regenerating.jpg" alt="Recharging defiance bar" />
							<figcaption>A defiance bar shortly after the enemy was broken, starting to recharge. You can
								see the buff indicating the enemy is now stunned.</figcaption>
						</figure>

						<p>
						When the bar is gray it is locked and crowd control effects are ignored as long as it is in that
						state.
						</p>

						<figure>
							<img src="images/breakbar_locked.jpg" alt="Locked defiance bar" />
							<figcaption>A locked defiance bar. This enemy is completely immune to crowd control while it
								is not doing its Overhead Smash attack.</figcaption>
						</figure>

						<p>
						What is a crowd control effect?
						There are two types, "hard" effects, which damage the defiance bar instantly (e.g. Stun, Knockdown,
						Daze...). These are effects that will stop you from attacking/moving completely, instantly. The
						damage depends on the type and the duration. You find see the defiance bar damages and skills
						for your class that are hard CC on the <a
							href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Defiance_bar#Skill_details">wiki</a>.
						</p>

						<p>
						Soft CC are conditions which damage the defiance bar over time, each has a good reason to do so,
						they would be too strong if they actually affected the boss enemy.
						</p>

						<!-- TODO: Icons for conditions -->

					<tip-title>Dodging and evading attacks</tip-title>
					<tip-desc>
						<p>Guild Wars 2 has a combat system in which completely avoiding damage is by far the most
						efficient strategy. Many skills are evades, blocks and similar. You can dodge as long as you
						have enough endurance which makes you invulnerable to all attacks.  You can apply <i>Aegis</i>,
						a boon that blocks the next attack you get hit by.</p>

						<p>Being good at avoiding attacks allows you to play with more offensive gear. Most attacks have
						tells you should be looking out for; if you see an enemy lifting their weapon they are likely to
						do an attack of some kind. Many attacks have <em>telegraphs</em> on the floor that show you
						where the attack will land. Dodging attacks is very important if you want to survive in higher
						end content. Tanking every single hit makes it either harder for you to survive or harder for
						healers to sustain you.</p>
					</tip-desc>
				</scr-tip>

				<scr-tip usefulness="5" importance="4">
					<tip-title>Food and utility consumables</tip-title>
					<tip-desc>
						<p>
						Food and utilities are consumables that can be used to temporarily increase your stats. Eating
						Food grants a Nourishment effect, using an Utility grants an Enhancement effect. You can only
						have one of each at the same time, using another food/utility consumable will overwrite the effect.
						</p>

						<p>
						The amount of stats gained from food is non-trivial and it is common decency to use food and
						utilities in end-game content. The best food is usually rather expensive, but there are
						typically cheaper variants.
						</p>

						<p>
						There are also many very cheap foods that are a good choice for playing in open world. Check the <a
							href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Food">wiki list of foods</a> and <a
						    href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Utility_item">utilities</a> and see for yourself if
					    any of those would be helpful to you. If you are leveling a character, you may be interested in
					    the extra experience gain as well. Some foods offer a higher experience bonus than others.
						</p>

				<scr-tip usefulness="5" importance="3">
					<tip-title>Deposit to storage</tip-title>
					<tip-desc>
						<p>The account vault not only contains a bank that allows you to store any items, it also
						contains a <em>Material Storage</em> that can by default store up to 250 of each material
						(may be increased by purchasing Storage Expanders).</p>

						<p>Unlike the bank, any materials in your inventory can be deposited to the storage from any
						place in the world. If you right-click a material, you can then click <em>Deposit
						Material</em> to deposit it to the Material Storage. If the option is gray, then your
						material storage for this item is full.</p>

						<figure>
							<img src="images/deposit_material.jpg" alt="Deposit material option" />
							<figcaption>The option to deposit a material to material storage.</figcaption>
						</figure>

						<p>You can also deposit all materials by clicking the gear icon in the top right of the
						inventory and selecting <em>Deposit All Materials</em>. This will ignore items in invisible
						bags and items that won't fit into the storage.</p>

						<figure>
							<img src="images/deposit_all.jpg" alt="Deposit all materials option" />

				<scr-tip usefulness="5" importance="3">
					<tip-title>Map instances and the&nbsp;<abbr title="Looking for Group">LFG</abbr>&nbsp;system</tip-title>
					<tip-desc>
						<p>
						With the introduction of the megaserver system, worlds are now only a WvW distinction.
						Instead, there are now multiple instances of the same map that anyone from the same region can
						join. The regions being EU and NA. While there is a Chinese version of the game, that one is
						completely separated, including the trading post and contains more pay-to-win features.
						</p>
						<p>
						If you can't find your friend, they are likely in a different instance. If you are both in the
						same party or squad, you can right click on your friend and choose to <em>Join</em> them in
						their map. That will move you to their instance. You can see the IP address of the server for
						the current instance by using the <code>/ip</code> command.
						</p>

						<figure>
							<img src="images/ip.jpg" alt="The result of typing /ip" />
							<figcaption>The ip address of an instance</figcaption>
						</figure>

						<p>
						If an instance gets too small, everyone gets a prompt to volunteer to leave (and get a bonus
						buff) or get kicked in an hour. If an instance is quite full, players will instead join another,
						potentially new instance when they enter the map. It is still possible to join players through a
						party or squad. At some point, the map fill completely and it is also impossible to join through
						that. At that point you can try spamming the join button, there is no reservation so when one
						player leaves you can take their place.
						</p>
						<p>
						The Looking for Group window is an interface for finding groups or squads. These may potentially
						be in another instance and can be used to move to it. In fact, it is common to <em>taxi</em>
						people into an empty map to help with events and this way you can participate even if your map
						instance was hopelessly empty.

					<tip-title>Linking items, skins, waypoints, skills</tip-title>
					<tip-desc>
						<p>
							If you hold Shift and left-click on an item, a hoverable link will be inserted in your
							chatbox. If you hold Ctrl instead, a message containing only the link will be sent
							instantly.

				<scr-tip usefulness="4" importance="1">
					<tip-title>Playing story instances with friends</tip-title>
					<tip-desc>
						<p>All story instances can be played with other players in your party. The enemies usually do
						not scale with more players so having others help you can be very useful for some achievements
						and instances. Simply enter the instance and other players in your group in the same map will
						get a prompt to join you. If you are at the same instance in your story as the instance owner
						you will get a prompt to accept progress.</p>

						<p>In some instances you get a special role as a guest, in many you won't be able to talk to
						most NPCs and you will only see some of the dialog of the instance owner.</p>

						<article class="message is-danger">
						  <div class="message-header">
							<p>Bug warning</p>
						  </div>
						  <div class="message-body">
							  <p>
								  Do not accept progress in Personal Story missions where the instance owner
								  chooses the next path to take. You will not get the same choice. In some instances,
								  you will in fact get no choice at all and a huge part of your story will be skipped
								  altogether (most notably "your biggest fear" part of the story). This will lead to
								  random NPCs appearing in the story who you won't even know at all.
							  </p>
							  <p>
								  Because of changes to the story system in Living World Season 2, this is not a problem
								  in any other content than the Personal Story that spans from your level 10 to 80. No
								  expansion stories or Living World instances are affected by this.

					<tip-title>Separating item stacks</tip-title>

				<scr-tip usefulness="3" importance="1">
					<tip-title>Invisible Bags</tip-title>
					<tip-desc>
						<p>
							There are multiple types of bags available. With some, specific items will fix those bags
							before other empty spaces, but the most useful one is an invisible bag.
						</p>
						<p>
							Items in an invisible bag cannot be sold, automatically salvaged, do not appear in vendor
							menus and will not move if your inventory is sorted. This allows you to safely store armor,
							unidentified gear and similar items you may not want to accidentally destroy.

					<tip-desc>
						<p>
							Special Action skills are not only used for many mechanics in raids and fractals, they are
							also very useful in the open world and in story missions. You need to be able to press it
							easily and reliably in group content and it won't hurt to have it easily accessible for

				<h3>Useful Settings</h3>

				<scr-tip usefulness="5" importance="1">
					<tip-title>Show All Usable Object Names</tip-title>
					<tip-desc>
						<p>
							This setting always shows names of all objects you can interact with, such as gathering nodes,
							achievement items, items used in renown hearts...
						</p>
						<!-- TODO: A mention about ALT or whichever key it is by default that shows it temporarily -->
					</tip-desc>
				</scr-tip>

				<scr-tip usefulness="3" importance="2">
					<tip-title>Show Target Health Percent</tip-title>
					<tip-desc>
						<p>
							This setting shows the current percentage of your target's health on their healthbar on top
							of your screen. This may be useful in raids or in open world meta events when you want to
							communicate how much health an enemy has left.
						</p>
						<figure>
							<img src="images/health_percentage.jpg" alt="Health percentage shown on a health bar" />
							<figcaption>Health percentage shown on a health bar</figcaption>

					</tip-desc>
				</scr-tip>

				<scr-tip usefulness="3" importance="1">
					<tip-title>Unzooming further</tip-title>
					<tip-desc>
						<p>
							You may find that the camera is not unzooming far enough by default. There are enemies that
							are so tall, you can't even see the damage amounts when you hit them or important icons that
							appear above their head. Increasing the <em>Vertical Position Far</em> in Camera sliders
							will help with that.
						</p>
					</tip-desc>
				</scr-tip>

				<scr-tip usefulness="3" importance="1">
					<tip-title>Action Camera</tip-title>
					<tip-desc>
						<p>
							Action Camera is a camera mode that is similar to a first/third mode shooter. It is used in
							some HoT adventures and can be toggled anywhere if you set the <em>Toggle Action Camera</em>
							Control (Controls &gt; Camera).
						</p>
					</tip-desc>
				</scr-tip>

				<scr-tip usefulness="2" importance="1">
					<tip-title>Walking</tip-title>
					<tip-desc>
						<p>
							There is a Control setting that allows you to toggle between running and walking.
						</p>
					</tip-desc>
				</scr-tip>

				<scr-tip usefulness="2" importance="1">
					<tip-title>Character Model Limit name may be misleading</tip-title>
					<tip-desc>
						<p>
							Character Model Limit is not only affected by players, it is also affected by enemies and
							other entities and objects. If this setting is set too low, some important effects will stop
							rendering (mostly a problem in raids) or in some cases (huge open world events), even your
							enemies won't be rendered, including bosses. The selected entity is always shown, but if
							there are multiple bosses (e.g. in the Serpent Ire event), the others may be invisible.
						</p>

				<h3>Earning and saving gold</h3>

				<scr-tip usefulness="3" importance="1">
					<tip-title>The waypoint discount</tip-title>
					<tip-desc>
						<p>
							One of the benefits for representing a guild is a Waypoint Discount, with the percentage
							depending on the upgrades of the guild.
						</p>
					</tip-desc>
				</scr-tip>

				<scr-tip usefulness="2" importance="1">
					<tip-title>The weekly Black Lion Chest Key</tip-title>
					<tip-desc>
						<p>
							You can obtain one Black Lion Chest Key a week by completing the level 10 personal story
							chapter. This resets at the typical weekly reset (7:30 UTC, Monday). The story can be done
							very quickly as long as you have extra <a
							href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Tome_of_Knowledge">Tomes of Knowledge</a> or similar
							items to level up quickly.
						</p>
						<p>
							This is typically done with the Human personal story, for details see the wiki page on <a
							href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Key_farming">Key farming</a>.
						</p>
					</tip-desc>
				</scr-tip>

				<h3>Tricks</h3>

				<scr-tip usefulness="3" importance="3">
					<tip-title>Chat link codes</tip-title>
					<tip-desc>
						<p>
							Linking items, skills and similar in chat is implemented by replacing a <em>chat code</em>
							by the text that can be hovered over. The codes look like this: <code>[&amp;AgHNSQEA]</code>.
						</p>
						<p>
							The wiki has chat codes for most items, skins and skills that can be pasted into the chat to
							preview them. Linking something doesn't mean that you actually own it, you can even link
							impossible items or amounts, such as this code: <code>[&amp;Av/2LQEA]</code>. You can
							encounter waypoint codes on many websites and tools for Guild Wars 2 that you can simply
							whisper yourself and then double-click to quickly teleport to the waypoint.
						</p>
						<p>
							If you are interested in how the codes are encoded, the wiki has a good <a
							href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Chat_link_format">article</a> on that.
						</p>

				<scr-tip usefulness="3" importance="1">
					<tip-title>Unlocking a mount below level 80</tip-title>
					<tip-desc>
						<p>
							If you own the Path of Fire expansion and do not have any character that is level 80, you
							can still unlock mounts, with the Raptor being the by far the easiest one.
						</p>
						<p>
							You will need a friend who has a level 80 character and Path of Fire as well to take you
							through the first story instance of PoF. For this, your friend has to activate the chapter,
							you have to be in a party with them and in the same instance in Lion's Arch. After they
							enter the instance, you need to join them. Since you will be underleveled, you just want to
							survive and make sure to unlock the mount in the village with raptors.
						</p>
						<p>
							You will be unable to learn any masteries that improve your Raptor's abilities until you
							are level 80, but at least now you have a friend on your journey to level 80.

				<h3>Interesting, but useless</h3>

				<scr-tip usefulness="1" importance="0">
					<tip-title>Targeting emotes</tip-title>
					<tip-desc>
						<p>
							You can target emotes by selecting a target and using an emote with <code>@</code>. Some

					<tip-title>Synchronizing emotes</tip-title>
					<tip-desc>
						<p>
							You can synchronize emotes by and using an emote with <code>*</code>. This puts the emote in
							a ~5 second queue.

						<p>
							Example: <code>/dance *</code>
