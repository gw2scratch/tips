						<p>Skritt living conditions reflect their lazy nature. The only farms they run are those which require an absolute minimum of work to maintain, so they tend to prefer cooked meat and fungi harvested from underground. They prefer to live in large hollows or caverns, known as "scratches," using rocks and underground passageways to build a safe environment. They do have architectural ability, and build huts or structures within the main area of their hollow out of the items they scavenge. The high concentration of skritt in their scratches means they're at their most intelligent and most dangerous to any attacker.</p>

				<p>GW2 Scratch is a collection of Guild Wars 2 tips, guides and tools that were deemed useful by the Skritt and their friends.</p>

				<h2>Tips</h2>
				<p> There are many tricks in Guild Wars 2 that are not obvious, not documented properly and can take a
				long time to figure out. This is an attempt to collect as many as possible and order them. For this
				reason we have two attributes for each tip: usefulness and importance.
				</p>

				<p><i>Usefulness</i> is a selfish measure and shows you how much useful this tip is to you.</p>

				<p><i>Importance</i> on the other hand is a measure of how much other players rely on you to know this.</p>

				<p>It is very possible that we have forgotten a trick or maybe don't even know them. There may also be
				mistakes or outdated information. Any contributions are welcome, feel free to report an issue or even
				create a pull request.</p>

				</scr-tip>

				<scr-tip usefulness="5" importance="4">
					<tip-title>Dodging and evading attacks</tip-title>
					<tip-desc>
						<p>Guild Wars 2 has a combat system in which completely avoiding damage is by far the most
						efficient strategy. Many skills are evades, blocks and similar. You can dodge as long as you
						have enough endurance which makes you invulnerable to all attacks.  You can apply <i>Aegis</i>,
						a boon that blocks the next attack you get hit by.</p>

						<p>Being good at avoiding attacks allows you to play with more offensive gear. Most attacks have
						tells you should be looking out for; if you see an enemy lifting their weapon they are likely to
						do an attack of some kind. Many attacks have <em>telegraphs</em> on the floor that show you
						where the attack will land. Dodging attacks is very important if you want to survive in higher
						end content. Tanking every single hit makes it either harder for you to survive or harder for
						healers to sustain you.</p>
					</tip-desc>

				<scr-tip usefulness="5" importance="3">
					<tip-title>Deposit to storage</tip-title>
					<tip-desc>
						<p>The account vault not only contains a bank that allows you to store any items, it also
						contains a <em>Material Storage</em> that can by default store up to 250 of each material (may
						be increased by purchasing Storage Expanders).</p>
						<p>Unlike the bank, any materials in your inventory can be deposited to the storage from any
						place in the world. If you right-click a material, you can then click <em>Deposit Material</em>
						to deposit it to the Material Storage. If the option is grey, then your material storage for
						this item is full.</p>
						<!-- TODO: Add screenshot -->
						<p>You can also deposit all materials by clicking the gear icon in the top right of the
						inventory and selecting <em>Deposit All Materials</em>. This will ignore items in invisible
						bags and items that won't fit into the storage.</p>

				<scr-tip usefulness="4" importance="4">
					<tip-title>Linking items, skins, waypoints, skills</tip-title>
					<tip-desc>
						<p>
							If you hold Shift and left-click on an item, a hoverable link will be inserted in your
							chatbox. If you hold Ctrl instead, a message containing only the link will be sent.

				<scr-tip usefulness="3" importance="2">
					<tip-title>Separating item stacks</tip-title>
					<tip-desc>
						<p>
							If you hold Alt while dragging items in your inventory, you will be prompted to input a
							stack size, this way you can split stacks into multiple.

						The official&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Main_Page">Guild Wars 2 Wiki</a>
					</tip-title>
					<tip-desc>
						<p>An <a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Main_Page">official wiki</a> is hosted by
						ArenaNet that any player can contribute to.</p>
						<p>The wiki contains information about maps, skills, items... pretty much anything in the game.
						It is written and maintained by players.</p>
						<p>If you are willing to contribute, you may also be interested in the <i>On Wiki of Gold</i>
						project. <a
						href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Guild_Wars_2_Wiki:Projects/On_Wiki_of_Gold">On Wiki of
							Gold</a> is a project that rewards you with in-game gold and gems for contributing to

				<scr-tip usefulness="4" importance="1">
					<tip-title>The <code>/wiki</code> command</tip-title>
					<tip-desc>
						<p>If you type <code>/wiki &lt;keyword&gt;</code> command in the chat window, the game will open
						a browser window with the wiki page for the keyword you type in.</p>
						<p>This allows you to quickly find out information about game content.</p>
						<p>Example:
						<!-- TODO: Add screenshot -->
						</p>

						<p>Not only can you search using text, you can also search by linking items, skins, waypoints,
						skills and similar. This brings you to the corresponding Guild Wars 2 Wiki article if it
						exists.</p>
						<p>Example:
						<!-- TODO: Add screenshot -->
						</p>

						<p>You can also search the wiki in other languages by prepending the language code and a colon,
						like this: <code>/wiki DE:Guild Wars 2</code>.</p>

						<p>There are many useful pages you can reach quickly from the game this way:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><code>/wiki ET</code> - Event Timers</li>
							<li><code>/wiki qal</code> - Quick access links</li>
							<!-- TODO: Add more -->

				<scr-tip usefulness="3" importance="1">
					<tip-title>Instantly opening reward chests</tip-title>
					<tip-desc>
						Right-clicking on a reward chest on the side of your screen will open them without showing any
						window and just add the rewards to your inventory instantly. This does not work with any chests
						with a selection of rewards.

				<scr-tip usefulness="4" importance="1">
					<tip-title>Finding unfinished POI/Heart/Vista on the map by hovering.</tip-title>
					<tip-desc>
						Hovering over the Point of Interest/Heart/Vista counts on the map shows unfinished ones on the
						map or scouts in case you don't have the relevant part of the map discovered.

				<scr-tip usefulness="4" importance="1">
					<tip-title>Using weapon swapping to speed up Core Tyria renown hearts</tip-title>
					<tip-desc>
						<p>Many renown hearts in core maps (that is, maps that existed before HoT and PoF expansions and
						Living World seasons 3) contain tasks where you interact with items such as collecting items from
						the ground, repairing things...</p>
						<p>The progress to the heart is added immediately when you interact and swapping weapons interrupts
						the channeling skill, which allows you to finish those hearts faster.</p>
						<p>Newly introduced renown hearts are designed with this workaround in mind, so this will
						usually not work there.</p>
					</tip-desc>
				</scr-tip>

				<scr-tip usefulness="4" importance="1">
					<tip-title>Playing story instances with friends</tip-title>
					<tip-desc>
						<p>All story instances can be played with other players in your party. The enemies usually do
						not scale with more players so having others help you can be very useful for some achievements
						and instances. Simply enter the instance and other players in your group in the same map will
						get a prompt to join you. If you are at the same instance in your story as the instance owner
						you will get a prompt to accept progress.</p>

						<p>In some instances you get a special role as a guest, in many you won't be able to talk to
						most NPCs and you will only see some of the dialog of the instance owner.</p>

						<article class="message is-danger">
						  <div class="message-header">
							<p>Bug warning</p>
						  </div>
						  <div class="message-body">
							  <p>
								  Do not accept progress in Personal Story missions where the instance owner
								  chooses the next path to take. You will not get the same choice. In some instances,
								  you will in fact get no choice at all and a huge part of your story will be skipped
								  altogether (most notably "your biggest fear" part of the story). This will lead to
								  random NPCs appearing in the story who you won't even know at all.
							  </p>
							  <p>
								  Because of changes to the story system in Living World Season 2, this is not a problem
								  in any other content than the Personal Story that spans from your level 10 to 80. No
								  expansion stories or Living World instances are affected by this.

				<scr-tip usefulness="3" importance="1">
					<tip-title>Right-clicking skill slots to select skills</tip-title>
					<tip-desc>
						You can right-click utility and elite skill slots to bring up the menu to swap to another skill.
						This is significantly easier than clicking the small arrow.
					</tip-desc>
				</scr-tip>

				<scr-tip usefulness="3" importance="1">
					<tip-title>Double-clicking waypoints teleports you instantly</tip-title>
					<tip-desc>
						Double-clicking on a waypoint on the minimap or on the world map will teleport you instantly
						without having to confirm the cost (as long as you are not in combat).
					</tip-desc>
				</scr-tip>

				<scr-tip usefulness="3" importance="1">
					<tip-title>Left-clicking on a commander icon allows you to join their squad</tip-title>
					<tip-desc>
						Left-clicking on a commander icon on the minimap or on the world map will show you a context
						menu that contains a <em>Join Squad</em> option.
					</tip-desc>
				</scr-tip>

				<scr-tip usefulness="3" importance="1">
					<tip-title>The <code>/sqjoin</code> and <code>/join</code> commands</tip-title>
					<tip-desc>
						<p><code>/sqjoin &lt;name&gt;</code> is a command for joining a squad.</p>
						<p><code>/join &lt;name&gt;</code> is a command for joining a party.</p>
						<p>
							These commands allow you to join a squad or a party if you specify either a character name
							of any character of someone in the squad/party or their account name. You can use a
							different character name than the character they are logged in now. The <code>/sqjoin</code>
							command only works if the squad has a commander.
						</p>
					</tip-desc>
				</scr-tip>

				<scr-tip usefulness="2" importance="1">
					<tip-title>Glyphs can be removed from gathering tools</tip-title>
					<tip-desc>
						Right-clicking on a gathering tool with a Glyph will offer an option to <em>Remove Upgrade</em>.
						Select this to get your Glyph back without having to swap in a different one or wait for the
						tool to get depleted.
					</tip-desc>
				</scr-tip>

				<scr-tip usefulness="3" importance="1">
					<tip-title>Guild Hall boosts</tip-title>
					<tip-desc>
						<p>
							The Tavern in Guild Halls offers 24-hour boosts for free. Selecting one will overwrite the
							previous one, so only one can be active at the same time. Boosts include a Magic Find
							increase, a PvP/WvW reward track rate increase, experience/karma gain and others. You can
							find a list on the <a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Nathan_the_Bartender">wiki</a>.
						</p>
						<p>
							The boost percentage is dependant on guild hall upgrades so a higher level guild may offer
							better boosts.
						</p>
					</tip-desc>
				</scr-tip>

				<scr-tip usefulness="3" importance="1">
					<tip-title>The Mentoring Badge</tip-title>
					<tip-desc>
						<p>
							One of the first Core Tyria masteries provides access to a mentor tag. This tag was intended
							to be used to mark yourself as a mentor for new players. Outside of starting maps it is
							usually used as a cheap alternative the the commander tag when you need to show a location
							on the map. It has no access to the commander squad features, but it is still visible on the
							map for anyone in the same instance. You can activate it in the party interface or toggle it
							with the <code>/mentor</code> command.
						</p>
						<p>
							Please do not mislead new players in starting maps by using it there and then not helping
							them.

				<scr-tip usefulness="3" importance="1">
					<tip-title>Hovering over Trading Post total price</tip-title>
					<tip-desc>
						<p>
						Hovering over the Total Price when selling an item will show you the <em>Estimated Profit</em>
						of the transaction (which is in fact revenue).
						</p>
						<!-- TODO: Screenshot -->
					</tip-desc>
				</scr-tip>

				<scr-tip usefulness="3" importance="1">
					<tip-title>Compact interface for the Trading Post</tip-title>
					<tip-desc>
						<p>
						Typing <code>I am Evon Gnashblade</code> into the search box will shrink the results by ignoring
						the icon size. This fits more items on your screen, however it is rather resource intensive. The
						compact mode can be turned off by repeating the process.
						</p>
						<!-- TODO: Screenshot -->
					</tip-desc>
				</scr-tip>

				<scr-tip usefulness="3" importance="1">
					<tip-title>Faster Mystic Forging</tip-title>
					<tip-desc>
						<p>
						You can close the Mystic Forge window after you click the <em>Forge</em> button and interact
						with the forge again to skip the animation of items being forged together. This allows you to
						forge significantly faster.
						</p>
					</tip-desc>
				</scr-tip>

				<scr-tip usefulness="3" importance="1">
					<tip-title>Invisible Bags</tip-title>
					<tip-desc>
						<p>
							There are multiple types of bags available. With some, specific items will fix those bags
							before other empty spaces, but the most useful one is an invisible bag.
						</p>
						<p>
							Items in an invisible bag cannot be sold, automatically salvaged, do not appear in vendor
							menus and will not move if your inventory is sorted. This allows you to safely store armor,
							unidentified gear and similar items you may not want to accidentally destroy.
						</p>
					</tip-desc>
				</scr-tip>

				<scr-tip usefulness="1" importance="1">
					<tip-title>Stack your free Level 80 boosts in shared inventory slots</tip-title>
					<tip-desc>
						If you bought all expansions, you received multiple free shared inventory slots, each
						containing a Level 80 boost. If you don't want to use them yet, stack them in a single inventory
						slot so that you can use the others for something else.
					</tip-desc>
				</scr-tip>

				<h3>Useful Settings</h3>

				<scr-tip usefulness="5" importance="1">
					<tip-title>Show All Usable Object Names</tip-title>
					<tip-desc>
						<p>
							This setting always shows names of all objects you can interact with, such as gathering nodes,
							achievement items, items used in renown hearts...
						</p>
						<!-- TODO: A mention about ALT or whichever key it is by default that shows it temporarily -->
					</tip-desc>
				</scr-tip>

				<scr-tip usefulness="3" importance="2">
					<tip-title>Show Target Health Percent</tip-title>
					<tip-desc>
						<p>
							This setting shows the current percentage of your target's health on their healthbar on top
							of your screen. This may be useful in raids or in open world meta events when you want to
							communicate how much health an enemy has left.
						</p>
						<!-- TODO: Screenshot -->
					</tip-desc>
				</scr-tip>

				<scr-tip usefulness="3" importance="1">
					<tip-title>Unzooming further</tip-title>
					<tip-desc>
						<p>
							You may find that the camera is not unzooming far enough by default. There are enemies that
							are so tall, you can't even see the damage amounts when you hit them or important icons that
							appear above their head. Increasing the <em>Vertical Position Far</em> in Camera sliders
							will help with that.
						</p>
					</tip-desc>
				</scr-tip>

				<scr-tip usefulness="3" importance="1">
					<tip-title>Action Camera</tip-title>
					<tip-desc>
						<p>
							Action Camera is a camera mode that is similar to a first/third mode shooter. It is used in
							some HoT adventures and can be toggled anywhere if you set the <em>Toggle Action Camera</em>
							Control (Controls &gt; Camera).
						</p>
					</tip-desc>
				</scr-tip>

				<scr-tip usefulness="2" importance="1">
					<tip-title>Walking</tip-title>
					<tip-desc>
						<p>
							There is a Control setting that allows you to toggle between running and walking.
						</p>
					</tip-desc>
				</scr-tip>

				<scr-tip usefulness="2" importance="1">
					<tip-title>Character Model Limit may be misleading</tip-title>
					<tip-desc>
						<p>
							Character Model Limit is not only affected by players, it is also affected by enemies and
							other entities and objects. If this setting is set too low, some important effects will stop
							rendering (mostly a problem in raids) or in some cases (huge open world events), even your
							enemies won't be rendered, including bosses. The selected entity is always shown, but if
							there are multiple bosses (e.g. in the Serpent Ire event), the others may be invisible.

				<h3>Earning and saving gold</h3>

				<scr-tip usefulness="3" importance="1">
					<tip-title>Waypoint discount</tip-title>
					<tip-desc>
						<p>
							One of the benefits for representing a guild is a Waypoint Discount, with the percentage
							depending on the upgrades of the guild.
						</p>
					</tip-desc>
				</scr-tip>

				<scr-tip usefulness="2" importance="1">
					<tip-title>The weekly Black Lion Chest Key</tip-title>
					<tip-desc>
						<p>
							You can obtain one Black Lion Chest Key a week by completing the level 10 personal story
							chapter. This resets at the typical weekly reset (7:30 UTC, Monday). The story can be done
							very quickly as long as you have extra <a
							href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Tome_of_Knowledge">Tomes of Knowledge</a> or similar
							items to level up quickly.
						</p>
						<p>
							This is typically done with the Human personal story, for details see the wiki page on <a
							href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Key_farming">Key farming</a>.
						</p>
					</tip-desc>
				</scr-tip>

				<h3>Tricks</h3>

				<scr-tip usefulness="3" importance="1">
					<tip-title>Getting a mount below level 80</tip-title>
					<tip-desc>
						<p>
							If you own the Path of Fire expansion and do not have any character that is level 80, you
							can still unlock mounts, with Raptor being the by far the easiest one.
						</p>
						<p>
							You will need a friend who has a level 80 character and Path of Fire as well to take you
							through the first story instance of PoF. For this, your friend has to activate the chapter,
							you have to be in a party and in the same instance in Lion's Arch. After they enter the
							instance, you need to join them. Since you will be underleveled, you just want to
							survive and make sure to unlock the mount in the village with raptors.
						</p>
						<p>
							You will be unable to learn any masteries that improve your Raptor's abilities until you
							have are level 80, but at least now you have a friend on your journey to level 80.
						</p>
					</tip-desc>
				</scr-tip>

				<scr-tip usefulness="3" importance="3">
					<tip-title>Chat link codes</tip-title>
					<tip-desc>
						<p>
							Linking items, skills and similar in chat is implemented by replacing a <em>chat code</em>
							by the text that can be hovered over. The codes look like this: <code>[&amp;AgHNSQEA]</code>.
						</p>
						<p>
							The wiki has chat codes for most items, skins and skills that can be pasted into chat to
							preview them. Linking something doesn't mean that you actually own it, you can even link
							impossible items or amounts, such as this code: <code>[&amp;Av/2LQEA]</code>. You can
							encounter waypoint codes on many websites and tools for Guild Wars 2 that you can simply
							whisper yourself and then double-click to quickly teleport to the waypoint.
						</p>
						<p>
							If you are interested in how the codes are encoded, the wiki has a good <a
							href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Chat_link_format">article</a> on that.
